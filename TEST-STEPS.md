# UI Refactor Testing Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the testing steps for the comprehensive UI enhancement of SIH-HACATHON. The refactor includes modern design components, animations, and improved responsiveness while preserving all existing functionality.

## New Dependencies Added
- `framer-motion`: For animations and micro-interactions
- `chart.js`: For interactive charts in dashboards
- `react-chartjs-2`: React wrapper for Chart.js
- `@heroicons/react`: Modern icon library

## Testing Environment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Expected: Server starts on http://localhost:5173 or similar port

## Core Functionality Testing

### Authentication Flow
1. **Register New User**
   - Navigate to `/register` 
   - Test Step 1: Enter full name and select role (Alumni/Student)
   - Verify: Form validation, progress indicator animation
   - Click "Continue" → Should advance to Step 2
   - Test Step 2: Enter email, password, optional phone
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Verify: Loading animation, success message, redirect to login

2. **Login Existing User**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter valid credentials
   - Verify: Form animations, loading states
   - Submit form
   - Expected: Redirect based on role:
     - Admin → `/adminDash`
     - Alumni → `/alumnidash` 
     - Student → `/studentdash`

### Dashboard Testing

#### Admin Dashboard
- Access: Login as admin user
- Test sections: Dashboard, Users, Events, Donations, Profile
- Verify: All data loads, charts display, navigation works
- Test responsiveness: Resize to mobile/tablet views

#### Alumni Dashboard  
- Access: Login as alumni user
- Test tabs: Dashboard, Profile, Events, Donations, Mentorship
- Verify: Profile editing, donation submission, event registration
- Check: Smooth tab transitions, data persistence

#### Student Dashboard
- Access: Login as student user
- Test sections: Dashboard, Mentors, Requests, Events, Profile
- Verify: Mentor search, mentorship requests, profile updates
- Check: Real-time updates, loading states

- [ ] High contrast mode compatibility

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. Charts require sample data for proper display
2. Some admin features may need additional API endpoints
3. Advanced animations require modern browser support
4. Glass morphism effects may not display in older browsers

### Future Enhancements
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Advanced chart interactions
- Real-time notifications
- Offline functionality
- Progressive Web App features

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Found
1. Switch back to main branch: `git checkout main`
2. Restore previous version: `npm install && npm run dev`
3. Document issues in GitHub Issues
4. Plan fixes before re-deployment

### Partial Rollback Options
- Disable animations: Set `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS
- Fallback components: Import old components if needed
- Progressive enhancement: Basic functionality works without JS
